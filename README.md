# Dog Breed Classifier
This project classifies dog breeds into one of **133** dog breeds using Pytorch

It includes a notebook with **6** parts <br/>
1. Human Face Detection(_Two methods used_)
2. Dog Detection(_Two pretrained models used_)
3. Classiying Dogs by training Neural Network From Scratch(Got **48%** accuracy)
4. Classifying Dogs By using pretrained model(Got **87%** accuracy)
5. Algorithm to detect human or dogs with the appropriate message
    * If dog detected then _predict the breed_
    * If human detected then _predict the most similar dog_
    * If neither print a message indication nothing detected
6. Testing the algorithm in step 5
